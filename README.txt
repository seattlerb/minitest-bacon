== DESCRIPTION:

minitest-bacon extends minitest with bacon-like functionality. It
should allow you to bridge 90+% of your bacon specs over to minitest.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Passes almost all of bacon's tests.
* Where they don't it is documented why they don't.

=== Differences with Bacon:

* Only one before/after block per describe (ie, they're just methods again).
* Object#should doesn't work outside of describe. Not sure what that's for.
* Tests are no longer order dependent. This is a Good Thingâ„¢.

== SYNOPSIS:

    require "minitest/bacon"

    describe "A new array" do
      before do
        @ary = Array.new
      end

      it "should be empty" do
        @ary.should.be.empty
        @ary.should.not.include 1
      end

      it "should have zero size" do
        @ary.size.should.equal 0
        @ary.size.should.be.close 0.1, 0.5
      end

      it "should raise on trying fetch any index" do
        lambda { @ary.fetch 0 }.
          should.raise(IndexError).
          message.should.match(/out of array/)

        # Alternatively:
        should.raise(IndexError) { @ary.fetch 0 }
      end

      it "should have an object identity" do
        @ary.should.not.be.same_as Array.new
      end

      # Custom assertions are trivial to do, they are lambdas returning a
      # boolean vale:
      palindrome = lambda { |obj| obj == obj.reverse }
      it "should be a palindrome" do
        @ary.should.be.a palindrome
      end

      it "should have super powers" do
        should.flunk "no super powers found"
      end
    end
